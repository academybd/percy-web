    <h4>What is a snapshot?</h4>
    <p>
      Each full-page render and visual diffÂ combined counts as a single snapshot.
    </p>
    <h4>What are parallel workers?</h4>
    <p>
      Percy is crafted to render your snapshots simultaneously in our custom parallel rendering infrastructure. The number of parallel workers is how many concurrent renderer processes are dedicated to your builds.

    <h4>What happens if I exceed the limits?</h4>
    <p>
      Nothing! We simply charge a small fee for each extra snapshot over your monthly plan, but your builds and workflow will not be interrupted. Larger plans include significantly more snapshots and lower the fee for extra visual diffs.
