      <p>
        I've been breaking computers since I was 10 and learning how to fix them along the way. I've worked at Google as a software engineer on the global web team, helping build the distributed tools and platforms underlying all of Google's websites, and at <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</a>, learning the ins and outs of startup engineering. I founded Percy to help solve the hard problems of visual QA for as many engineering teams as possible.

      <h4>Tim Haines</h4>
      <h5>Co-Founder, COO</h5>

        Growing up in New Zealand, a lot of my youth was spent in front of a green screen on a suitcased-sized computer. I started building business software as a teenager, and loved the puzzles it offered. Before Percy I built Respondly, a customer service platform for Twitter (acquired in 2015). Way back in 2009 - 2012 I made a best-of-Twitter site called Favstar, and grew it to community of 3 million monthly visitors.

        Having shipped UI glitches in the past, I'm excited that Percy helps people find UI bugs 🐞 early, and enables teams to ship UI updates with confidence.
